/**
 * Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.
 * A magic number is defined as a number that can be expressed as a power of 5 or a sum of unique powers of 5.
 * First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.
 *
 * Example
 * Input : A = 3 Output : 30
 * Explanation :
 * Magic Numbers in increasing order are [5, 25, 30, 125, 130, ...]
 * 3rd element in this is 30
 *
 * Input : A = 10 Output : 650
 * Explanation 2:
 * In the sequence shown in explanation 1, 10th element will be 650.
