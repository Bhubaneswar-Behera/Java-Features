/**
 * Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N.
 * Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
 * You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1].
 * There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.
 *
 * Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
 * NOTE:
 * 1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint.
 *      That is to say, a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
 * 2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards.
 *  This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.
 * Return the ans % 10000003.
 *
 * Input : A = 2  B = 5  C = [1, 10]        Output : 50
 * Explanation : Possibility 1:- One painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55 units.
 *               Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
 *               There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
 *                ans = 50 % 10000003
 *
 * Input : A = 10 B = 1  C = [1, 8, 11, 3]  Output : 11
 * Explanation : Each block is painted by a painter so, Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, painter 3 paints block 3
 *               and painter 4 paints block 4, time taken = max(1, 8, 11, 3) = 11
 *               ans = 11 % 10000003
